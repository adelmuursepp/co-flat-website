## Website for Co-Flat, apartment-sharing website 

Solo coded a platform for apartment rentals in Tallinn on Ruby on Rails. Integrated authentication, online payments with Stripe, implemented a relational database with bookings, different types of users, etc. Image uploading with Cloudinary, implemented address search with Algolia API. Mobile responsive design created with Bootstrap library. Learned to work with Heroku server, Github and had fun working on a project!âœ¨ðŸ’»
